# üìö Evaluation of LLMs on Sinhala Structured Examination Questions (Grades 6‚Äì11)

This repository contains a comprehensive literature review on the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in answering structured examination questions in Sinhala, specifically focusing on grades 6‚Äì11. The literature review was enhanced and extended using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to ensure depth, coherence, and thematic consistency while preserving all original citations.

## üîç 2. Gaps & To-verify

> Claims introduced during enhancement that require human verification, additional citations, or clarification.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Claim about impact of Sinhala morphology on LLM tokenization performance ‚Äì needs source.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mention of local syllabus alignment for Grades 6‚Äì11 ‚Äì requires verification or curriculum citation.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance difference between multilingual vs. domain-specific Sinhala LLMs ‚Äì no cited benchmarks.
